## Pitch

  Imagine an app that streamlines connecting students for group projects in school. It's called ConnectMates and it solves a major pain point.

Forming groups the traditional way is chaotic and time-consuming. People end up with mismatched schedules or skills. ConnectMate brings order through a simple yet powerful matching algorithm.

Students create profiles detailing their majors, interests, abilities and availability. When it's time to start a project, they opt-in with their criteria like topic or deadline. ConnectMate scans profiles and starts suggesting partially randomized groups that have high compatibility scores.

Students can view suggested matches, their compatibility likeliness, and even message others pre-grouping to confirm interest level and details. Once they agree, ConnectMate officially forms their group with all the needed profiles in one place.

Teachers no longer spend class time wrangling groups. Students are more likely to gel with people of similar passions and complementary skills. Better formed groups mean less stress and more focus on the work.

## Description
ConnectMate is a React App that connects you with other people of similar interests so you can find the right group. You can create an account, add your interests, and find others with those same interests to form a group so you can work on projects.

## Installation
After cloning the repository, you want to run ```npm i``` in the root folder. After that, you want to run ```npm run seed``` to fill in the default user and interests. After thats done, you can simply run ```npm run develop``` to launch the app and start browsing all the site has to offer!

## Usage
If you dont have an account, click the top-left corner and click "login" and create an account. You can click on your profila page and add a little bio about yourself. You can also then add your interests to your profile. Near the top of the screen, you can search for specific users by name or by what they're interested in (Ex. Front-End).

## Testing
We have a single test for this project, which can be run by first going into the client directory and running ```npm run test```.
