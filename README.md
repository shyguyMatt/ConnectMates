## Pitch

  Imagine an app that streamlines connecting students for group projects in school. It's called ConnectMates and it solves a major pain point.

Forming groups the traditional way is chaotic and time-consuming. People end up with mismatched schedules or skills. ConnectMate brings order through a simple yet powerful matching algorithm.

Students create profiles detailing their majors, interests, abilities and availability. When it's time to start a project, they opt-in with their criteria like topic or deadline. ConnectMate scans profiles and starts suggesting partially randomized groups that have high compatibility scores.

Students can view suggested matches, their compatibility likeliness, and even message others pre-grouping to confirm interest level and details. Once they agree, ConnectMate officially forms their group with all the needed profiles in one place.

Teachers no longer spend class time wrangling groups. Students are more likely to gel with people of similar passions and complementary skills. Better formed groups mean less stress and more focus on the work.
